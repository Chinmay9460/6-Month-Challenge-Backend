🚀 6-Month Backend + Data Engineering Mastery Plan
📅 Month 1 – Foundations + SQL Power

Backend (Java Core + DSA):

JVM internals, garbage collection, memory model.

Concurrency: threads, locks, executors, CompletableFuture.

DSA: 50–60 LeetCode Mediums (arrays, strings, sliding window, hashmaps).

Read: Effective Java (cover to cover).

Data (SQL First):

Master SQL:

Window functions, CTEs, JOINS, GROUP BY, indexes.

Platform: StrataScratch + LeetCode Database.

Mini Project:

Create a SQL-heavy dashboard (Postgres) for analytics.

Example: Sales DB → queries like “Top 5 products by revenue in last 30 days.”

✅ Checkpoint:

Write multi-threaded Java code confidently.

Solve at least 50 SQL queries with complex joins & windows.

📅 Month 2 – Spring Boot + ETL Basics

Backend:

Spring Boot advanced:

REST APIs, Spring Security (JWT), Spring Data JPA.

Reactive WebFlux.

Databases:

Postgres (indexes, query plans).

Redis caching.

Data:

Learn ETL concepts:

Batch vs Streaming pipelines.

Intro to Apache Airflow (task DAGs).

Build a mini ETL pipeline:

CSV → Airflow DAG → Transform → Load into Postgres.

DSA: Trees, Linked Lists, Stack/Queue (60–70 problems).

✅ Checkpoint:

Deploy a Spring Boot REST API with JWT auth + Postgres DB.

First Airflow DAG running on local machine.

📅 Month 3 – Distributed Systems + Streaming

Backend:

System design basics: caching, load balancing, CAP theorem.

Hands-on with Docker (multi-stage builds).

Deploy Spring Boot service in Docker.

Data:

Kafka deep dive:

Producers, consumers, partitions, offsets.

Build Kafka → consumer pipeline in Java.

Spark basics (PySpark or Scala).

Mini project:

Kafka (ingest logs) → Spark (transform) → Postgres (store results).

DSA:

Graphs + BFS/DFS problems.

At least 70–80 new LeetCode problems.

✅ Checkpoint:

Kafka pipeline working end-to-end.

Spark job processes real Kafka data → aggregates into DB.

📅 Month 4 – Real Project Buildout

Main Project Start → “Distributed Job Scheduler with ETL Pipeline”

Components:

Spring Boot backend for job definitions.

Scheduler: DAG execution (topological sort, retries).

Kafka → logs all job executions.

Spark pipeline processes logs for analytics.

Store job run history in Postgres.

Redis caching for fast job lookups.

Airflow to orchestrate extra ETL jobs.

Backend add-ons:

Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana.

Spring Boot integration tests (JUnit5 + Testcontainers).

DSA:

Dynamic Programming + advanced graph problems.

✅ Checkpoint:

Scheduler runs jobs in DAG order.

Kafka → Spark → DB analytics pipeline works.

Monitoring dashboard online.

📅 Month 5 – Scaling + Cloud

Backend:

Kubernetes basics (minikube/kind).

Deploy microservices on K8s.

Service mesh basics (Istio/Linkerd).

Data:

Cloud Storage:

AWS S3 → store pipeline results.

Glue/Athena for querying data.

Extend ETL:

Kafka → Spark → S3 → Redshift/Parquet.

Testing:

Load testing with JMeter.

Contract testing with Pact.

DSA:

70–100 hard problems (DP on graphs, union-find, advanced trees).

✅ Checkpoint:

Project running on Kubernetes cluster.

ETL pipeline stores results in S3 + queries via Athena.

📅 Month 6 – Resume Polish + Open Source

Finalize Project:

“Distributed Job Scheduler + ETL Analytics.”

Spring Boot microservices.

Kafka + Spark ETL pipeline.

Airflow orchestrating extra jobs.

Monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana).

Deployed on Kubernetes + AWS.

Resume Boosters:

Open source:

Contribute a small feature/bug fix to Airflow, Spark, or Kafka.

Write technical blog:

“How I built a distributed job scheduler with Kafka + Spark.”

Interview Prep:

Mock system design interviews weekly.

SQL challenges + backend coding problems.

DSA final push: 50 hardest problems.

✅ Final Outcome:

One resume-killer hybrid project (Backend + Data Eng).

Spring Boot + Cloud + System Design ready.

SQL + ETL + Kafka + Spark exposure.

You can apply confidently to Backend Engineer and Data Engineer roles.
